## Development Roadmap — OvergodIdle

Timeline assumes a lean team; adjust as staffing changes. Milestones end with a playable WebGL build on GitHub Pages.

### P0 — Prototype (2–3 weeks)
- Telegram Mini App bootstrap (template + username UI)
- Idle loop v0: Faith generation, basic upgrades, offline gains
- Simple ascension prototype (1 reset, 1 meta node)
- CI/CD to Pages; basic analytics events
Acceptance: 10-minute loop; stable on mobile Telegram

### P1 — Alpha (4–6 weeks)
- Ecosystem layer: biomes, growth knobs affecting Faith
- Sects and Qi: rank-ups impact multipliers
- Expeditions (timers) and 2 artifacts
- Monetization rails (Stars/TON via Openfort) behind feature flag

Acceptance: 1-day retention targetable; soft spend toggled in staging

### P2 — Beta (4–6 weeks)

- Telemetry dashboards; balancing pass
Acceptance: Season loop complete; deploy to production Pages

### Launch (2 weeks)
- Stability, polish, device matrix checks

Acceptance: Live ops calendar, on-call rotation established

### Post-Launch (ongoing)

### Tracks
