## Game Design Document (GDD) — OvergodIdle

### High Concept
You are a nascent god cultivating a fledgling world. Over time, sentient beings emerge and grow through cultivation (Eastern fantasy influence), advancing from primitive tribes to celestial sects. As their patron, you shape ecosystems, grant boons, and guide civilizations through eras, collecting Faith and Qi to unlock cosmic upgrades. Designed as a Telegram Mini App with optional on-chain collectibles via Openfort.

### Design Pillars
- Idle-first, session-light: progress accrues while offline; return loops are rewarding.
- Depth via layers: planet sim → populations → sects → heroes/Artifacts → cosmic ascension.
- Decisions over clicks: meaningful godly choices with visible, compounding effects.
- Social by default: Telegram-native share/referral, channels, seasonal ladders.
- Fair monetization: cosmetics/boosts/expedite; avoid pay-to-win walls.

### Target Platforms
- Primary: Telegram Mini App (WebGL in Telegram WebApp)
- Browser (debug/dev)

### Core Loop (5–60s)
1. Collect faith/qi and milestone rewards
2. Spend on upgrades (ecosystem tuning, civilization policies, sect research)
3. Trigger cultivation events (breakthroughs, expeditions)
4. Queue long timers (rituals, ascensions, construction)
5. Share/referral or check leaderboards; close app

### Meta Loop (hours–days)
- Unlock new biomes/continents → spawn new populations
- Form sects; appoint heroes; craft Artifacts
- Soft reset (Ascension): convert progress into permanent boons (Constellations) that multiply next run
- Seasons: limited-time goals and cosmetic rewards

### Systems Overview
- Resources
  - Faith (soft): generated by populations; main spend for upgrades
  - Qi (soft): from cultivators/sects; gates breakthroughs and mystical tech
  - Essence (rare soft): from events/bosses; crafts Artifacts
  - Stardust (hard/premium): purchased with Stars/TON; used for cosmetics, expedite, season pass
  - Relics (collectible, optionally on-chain): cosmetic/economic light utility
- Populations & Ecosystem
  - Biome knobs (fertility, climate, hazards) influence growth/yield
  - Happiness/Doctrine impacts Faith rate and unrest risk
- Cultivation & Sects
  - Ranks: Mortal → Qi Cleansing → Foundation Establishment → Core Formation → Nascent Soul → Dao Integration → Heavenly Tribulation → Divine Ascendant
  - Sects research, produce Qi, unlock techniques
- Heroes & Artifacts
  - Named units with traits; equip Artifacts; run expeditions (timers)
- Ascension (Soft Reset)
  - Convert run progress into Constellation Points; unlock global multipliers and new eras
- Events & Bosses
  - Time-limited modifiers; boss raids with shared Telegram goals

### Progression & Unlocks
- Tech trees per layer (ecosystem, civics, sects)
- Era gates: Stone → Bronze → Iron → Mystic → Celestial
- Ascension unlocks: new biomes, sect paths, artifact slots

### Monetization Summary (details in pricing-model.md)
- Cosmetics (skins for planet, UI themes, artifact VFX)
- Expediters (queue/time boosters), fair caps
- Season Pass (cosmetic + QOL line)
- Starter bundles, referral rewards
- Optional on-chain collectibles (limited cosmetics/Relics), no core power

### Social/Telegram Features
- Deep links (`startapp`) to invite friends; referral bonuses
- Channel posts with leaderboard snapshots
- Guilds (later): sect alliances for cooperative events

### KPIs (initial targets)
- D1 35–45%, D7 8–12%, D30 2–4%, ARPDAU $0.03–$0.08, Session length 3–7 min

### Content Cadence
- Week 1: balance patches; QoL
- Biweekly: mini-events + artifacts
- Monthly: season reset, new cosmetic set, 1 new system knob

### UX Guidelines
- Always show “what improved”—clear multipliers and deltas
- Respect idle time; celebrate breakthroughs
- One-tap re-queue for recurring timers

### Anti-cheat & Integrity (lightweight)
- Server-stamp last online; clamp offline gains to max window
- Signed event tickets for boss participation; cross-check with backend

### Accessibility
- Colorblind-safe palette, scalable UI, reduced motion option
