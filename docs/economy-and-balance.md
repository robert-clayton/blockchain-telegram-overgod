## Economy & Balance — OvergodIdle

### Currencies
- Faith (soft): baseline generator
- Qi (soft): cultivation multiplier; tied to sect rank
- Essence (rare soft): from bosses/events; crafts Artifacts
- Stardust (hard): cosmetics/expedite/season; limited power via QoL only

### Curves
- Idle gain: exponential early, logarithmic clamps late per era
- Upgrade costs: geometric with periodic discount resets at Ascension
- Offline cap: e.g., 8–12 hours baseline; extendable via upgrades

### Sinks & Sources Balance
- Ensure at least 1.2× more soft sinks than predictable sources to avoid runaway inflation; use seasonal resets

### Ascension Design
- Convert progress to Constellation Points (CP)
- CP nodes: +% Faith, +% Qi, +offline cap, +queue size, unlock new biome

### Events
- Mini-events alter one knob (e.g., +Hazards ⇒ +Essence)
- Boss raids: community contribution goal; reward cosmetics + Essence

### Anti-Exploits
- Time travel clamp; expedition speed floor
- Server-stamped last_seen; max offline rewards
