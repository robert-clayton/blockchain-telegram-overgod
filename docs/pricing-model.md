## Pricing & Monetization — OvergodIdle

Goals: sustainable F2P; fair advantages; lean on cosmetics/QoL; leverage Telegram-native flows and optional blockchain collectibles via Openfort.

### Currencies
- Soft: Faith, Qi, Essence
- Hard: Stardust (purchased via Telegram Stars/TON; also earn small amounts via season/quests)
- Collectibles (optional on-chain via Openfort): Relics (cosmetic-first)

### Primary Sinks
- Expedite/Queue Boosters: speed ritual/build timers; daily caps to avoid skipping entire loops
- Cosmetics: planet skins, UI themes, artifact VFX; limited editions (non-power)
- Season Pass: dual-track rewards (free/premium). Premium track grants cosmetics, QOL (extra loadout slot, +queue length), and bonus soft-currency rewards (no exclusive power)
- Starter Packs: 3 tiers ($1.99, $4.99, $9.99) one-time per account
- Rename/Customizations: hero rename, sect emblem

### Telegram-Native
- Use Stars or TON (via Openfort) with regionalized prices
- Referral rewards: when invitee reaches milestones, both get cosmetic tokens or Stardust trickles; avoid direct pay-per-invite

### On-chain Strategy (Openfort)
- Custodial wallets; gas abstracted
- On-chain limited Relics (cosmetic) with transparent supply and seasonal drops
- Optional secondary market via partner marketplace; 10% creator fee routed to events pool
- Strict separation: no pay-to-win stats from on-chain items

### Pricing Guidance (initial)
- Stardust bundles: $0.99 (Small), $4.99, $9.99, $19.99, $49.99
- Expedite: priced to reduce 30–60 minutes for ~$0.20–$0.40 equivalent
- Season Pass: ~$4.99 per 30-day season
- Cosmetics: $0.99–$14.99 depending on scope/rarity; limited drops slightly higher

### Ads
- Not available inside Telegram Mini Apps; no interstitials/rewarded ads planned

### Compliance & Store Policies
- Follow Telegram Commerce and local regulations; clear refund/help link

### Success Metrics
- ARPDAU $0.03–$0.08; conversion 1.5–3.5%; payer retention +20% vs baseline; cosmetic attach rate > 8%
